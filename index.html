<h2>Space</h2>
<p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!</p>
<p>Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.</p>
<p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>
<p>I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.</p>
